# W4P5-JavaScript

Write a JavaScript function that takes the lengths of the two shorter sides of a
right triangle as its parameters. Return the hypotenuse of the triangle,
computed using Pythagorean theorem, as the functionâ€™s result. Your program
must read the lengths of the shorter sides of a right triangle from the user, use
your function to compute the length of the hypotenuse, and display the result.

Devise multiple test cases for your program, and carry out testing to ensure
that your program delivers the expected results.
